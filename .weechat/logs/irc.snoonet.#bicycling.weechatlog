2014-12-10 22:23:10	agwan	Bikes Direct has a pile of bikes that will work for you. though in the 600 dollar range your Local Bike Shop will have many options.
2014-12-10 22:23:41	agwan	there are a LOT of questions to go over, if you're serious about getting that "just right" bicycle.
2014-12-10 22:23:43	epon	many basemodels to break your heart and wallet when they break

2014-12-10 22:24:41	agwan	in your price range nothing is going to be cutting edge or speedy. but there is a lot that's reliable.
2014-12-10 22:24:45	sundevil	i work at a sports authority and thought about getting one we have there, but after reading about trayl and diamondback it seems like there are some better ones out there
2014-12-10 22:25:39	agwan	There are definitely better values, though I've seen some okay bike at SA.

2014-12-10 22:26:15	agwan	any Local bike shop will have a lot of options in your price range.
2014-12-10 22:26:32	agwan	I'm partial to hybrid. which is technically what I ride.
2014-12-10 22:26:44	auviga	KpaBap: nice shoe
2014-12-10 22:26:49	sundevil	that's what i've figured, but figured since I'm lazy i would come here for help first
2014-12-10 22:26:59	agwan	hybrids are generally going to cost less. unless it's my bike. my bike is silly, though.
2014-12-10 22:27:26	agwan	Trek, Scott and Specialized all have some sort of affordable hybrid.
2014-12-10 22:28:01	agwan	I'm sure there are a lot more brands that do as well.
2014-12-10 22:28:29	sundevil	yep, after just casual browsing and reading i've found a few that fit what I'm looking for
2014-12-10 22:28:40	sundevil	any brands i should absolutely stay away from?
2014-12-10 22:29:44	Prime_Factor	Stay away from K-mart / Walmart / Target bicycle shaped objects.
2014-12-10 22:29:52	agwan	the big box brands of course. But at this price point they're all roughly the same quality. not a lot of bad, because none of the bikes are really all that mind blowing.
2014-12-10 22:29:56	agwan	what are your top picks?
2014-12-10 22:30:22	agwan	I mean, all the LBS bikes are roughly the same quality.

2014-12-10 22:34:39	agwan	if you can really get that bike for 250, It would be a good value.
2014-12-10 22:34:43	agwan	they suck.
2014-12-10 22:35:01	agwan	if you had to spend over 400 for it. I'd push for a bike shop.

2014-12-10 22:36:36	agwan	I'm saying any LBS with major brand support has some sort of hybrid that is priced between 300 to 600 dollars.
2014-12-10 22:36:58	agwan	Raleigh, Kona, Jamis... the list goes on.
2014-12-10 22:37:05	sundevil	ahhh gotcha
2014-12-10 22:37:42	agwan	personal preference, don't get a bike that is all aluminum. at this price point that might mean steel. if it does make sure it is graded, and not High-ten.

2014-12-10 23:19:12	Prime_Factor	Riding in the wind is demotivating, but it makes you a stronger rider.
2014-12-10 23:19:51	dvq	riding through Niles Canyon with the wind doesn't make you a stronger rider, deader maybe. 
2014-12-10 23:20:09	dvq	Its a 2 lane winding road that goes for like 7 miles
2014-12-10 23:20:16	dvq	people act like its a race track doing 75 in a 35

2014-12-10 23:40:25	beardedw1zard	yes that was very surprising
2014-12-10 23:40:45	beardedw1zard	but prob the grass is just dormant
2014-12-10 23:40:52	beardedw1zard	and when water comes, it turns green again
2014-12-10 23:40:56	beardedw1zard	rather than a bunch of new growth exclusively
2014-12-10 23:41:00	dvq	yeah, when it gets water, it'll grow a few inches a day

2014-12-11 00:22:12	gamaliel	Where else can I look? I've been checking craigslist for a while now and can't find anything.  I got about 400 I can spend
