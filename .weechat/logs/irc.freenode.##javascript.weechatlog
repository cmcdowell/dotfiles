2014-11-02 22:27:04	cheaterman	It also avoids "duplicating" the DOM between PHP and JS
2014-11-02 22:27:08	ljharb	cheaterman: and every bit of content would have a unique canonical URL, and you'd only use ajax and pushState together to avoid a normal page navigation.
2014-11-02 22:27:13	cheaterman	Which was my initial issue
2014-11-02 22:27:24	cheaterman	Yay that was the idea
2014-11-02 22:27:36	cheaterman	Even tho it's not really navigation, it's form submission, but it's the same
2014-11-02 22:27:40	ljharb	ie, make everything work with zero JS first, and then layer JS on top of it where it helps the experience
2014-11-02 22:27:45	joeytwiddle	jbud, if you want all the module to have access to each other, then you may want the ServiceLocator pattern: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/service-locator.html (one object that references all the others, and all the others have a reference to it).
2014-11-02 22:27:52	joeytwiddle	Although I'm not sure how you would set that up with requirejs (perhaps call init on each module, passing it the ServiceLocator ... argh)
2014-11-02 22:27:56	cheaterman	Yes ljharb and i <noscript> the PHP fallback
2014-11-02 22:28:01	cheaterman	I get it :D thanks alot
2014-11-02 22:28:07	ljharb	cheaterman: oh no, no noscript at all
2014-11-02 22:28:12	cheaterman	Why?
2014-11-02 22:28:23	joeytwiddle	jbud, since you are writing an app, and not a library, perhaps you should just expose global objects :-p
2014-11-02 22:28:25	ljharb	cheaterman: your entire site is noscript content. and then you add JS on top of it
2014-11-02 22:28:30	cheaterman	I merely want to hide the PHP fallback button, because if JS is enabled, the submission will be JS-driven

2014-11-02 22:28:42	cheaterman	You mean I should use JS to hide it
2014-11-02 22:28:42	cheaterman	Okay
2014-11-02 22:28:43	ljharb	cheaterman: noscript only works in browsers that don't support JS, or have it disabled
2014-11-02 22:28:51	cheaterman	Yes that's the goal?
2014-11-02 22:28:58	cheaterman	Like say I have a <select>
2014-11-02 22:29:07	cheaterman	And its submission is handled by AJAX
2014-11-02 22:29:08	ljharb	the majority case is actually you have a JS error. or that a .js file fails to load because you're on a cellphone.
2014-11-02 22:29:15	cheaterman	I'd have the submit button inside a <noscript> tag?

2014-12-12 03:35:57	Agamemnus	I understand

2014-12-12 03:38:05	Agamemnus	of course you need to cover up
