2014-10-12 20:02:44	cocotton	Hey channel, I'm using vim to edit some html files and the syntax highlighting is great. Now, my problem is that I have .ejs files that contains only HTML language at the time, but because of the file extension, I don't get the nice syntax highlighting. Does anyone know how I could fix that?

2014-10-13 09:11:34	sakkemo	romainl: I just wanted to know whether you use/suggest using those, since colorschemes that suggest you change (I get that this is not the point with apprentice, you are just providing the option) the 16 colors tend to break more things than they solve, or are extremely prone to user errors on install

2014-10-15 21:56:15	jebbster	I track my TODO list via vim-notes. I've written a function for yanking TODO items from one note file and putting them in another. The function takes the file names as two arguments. Ideally I'd like to have it assume the current file name as the new note, and to calculate the name of the other.
2014-10-15 21:56:22	jebbster	paradigm: thanks, will take a look
2014-10-15 21:56:26	paradigm	you could maybe script around that plugin

When I try to run the new version of Macvim that I've installed and replaced the other with it comes up with this error and crashes immediately: http://pastebin.com/TWyJiSs4
