2014-10-12 19:31:31	chazmichaelmicha	Hey guys, a friend and I are relatively new to Django and have been trolling the docs for a while. We are playing with a template and have taken a prexisting directory 'users' - and copied the folder and modified the existing values - hoping to stand up our own page.
2014-10-12 19:31:54	chazmichaelmicha	Am I correct in assuming that each local app requires at a minimum, models.py, urls.py, views.py ?

2014-10-12 19:51:07	forcer	chazmichaelmicha: "Module" and "package" are terms from Python. A module is a file foo.py, a package is a directory with a file __init__.py in it. "import foo" import a module or package named "foo". To be imported, it needs to be on sys.path. This is unrelated to Django or any of its convention, this is basic Python stuff.
2014-10-12 19:52:34	chazmichaelmicha	forcer: Yeah, we are sucking it up. Ok. Derp. I knew that.
2014-10-12 19:52:57	forcer	chazmichaelmicha: A Django Project or App are both just packages for Python. Adding an app to INSTALLED_APPS imports it on Django startup. Nothing special there. models is a module inside your app which defines models using Django's ORM. And templates are specially-formatted files that can be used by Django's template engine to generate text (usually HTML).
2014-10-12 19:53:18	chazmichaelmicha	forcer: Ok. I think I follow.
2014-10-12 19:53:24	chazmichaelmicha	forcer: We started out with: https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django
2014-10-12 19:54:07	forcer	chazmichaelmicha: Your problem is that "import remind" fails. This is completely unrelated to Django. Fix that problem first.
2014-10-12 19:54:20	forcer	chazmichaelmicha: For example, is there a file called __init__.py inside the remind directory?
2014-10-12 19:54:43	chazmichaelmicha	forcer: and simply want to add another page w/ a basic form. If you look in {repo_name} -> {repo_name} -> {users} - we wanted to add a new page, so we copied that dir.

2014-10-12 22:20:29	jwhite007	how about with "kwargs['email_address']"
2014-10-12 22:20:46	honestly	how about user = User.objects.get(email=email_address)
2014-10-12 22:20:56	@apollo13	first off all make sure you get errors from that receiver and don't silence them!
2014-10-12 22:21:03	@apollo13	otherwise all of it becomes guesswork
2014-10-12 22:21:25	jwhite007	apollo13: how do i go about getting errors from the receiver?
2014-10-12 22:21:48	@apollo13	jwhite007: I don't know, django usually shows errors, so somewhere you code emitting the signal seems to silence it
2014-10-12 22:22:22	jwhite007	apollo13: i have debug set to True
2014-10-12 22:22:27	@apollo13	so?
2014-10-12 22:22:38	jwhite007	well… i'm not getting any errors.
2014-10-12 22:22:50	@apollo13	well then __your__ code is silencing them somewhere
2014-10-12 22:23:09	@apollo13	User.objects.get(email='email_address') [sic] would raise UserDoesNotExist since you can never have such email address
2014-10-12 22:23:28	karanlyons	Thanks, FunkyBob & apollo13.

2014-10-15 18:19:40	+carljm	The manager proxies most queryset methods, but does not provide a proxy delete(), to avoid accidental deletion of all your models. If you really want to delete everything, you have to say so explicitly.

2014-10-15 18:40:25	Muchoz	Can someone give me some tips with my model? I'm working on a backend where a sandwich can be made for example. For every type of ingredients (vegetables, meat...) I want those to be in a list (Ingredients are a seperate model, I'm using a ManyToMany relation now), but then those are the default values. So let's say the user chooses a cheese sandwich and he wants to add another type of cheese and remove the old cheese he should be able to do that. I
2014-10-15 18:40:25	Muchoz	 would like for this to be as convenient as possible. Any ideas? (Simple code example: http://hastebin.com/cufobubeqo.py)

2014-10-15 19:51:48	mcdiesel	I’m having an issue with list_editable in the admin.  I have 1 CharField defined in list_editable, but occasionally I get an IntegrityError for a different non-nullable ForeignKey field when saving from the list view (it says it violates not-null constraint).  It seems to work correctly about 60% of the time, and the other 40% results in this error.  Any ideas on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.
