2014-12-11 23:12:51	emr1-28	im trying to eat a lot of pineapples this week so my cum will taste better when i see my gf tomorrow
2014-12-11 23:13:02	Boof	thats so sweet of u
2014-12-11 23:13:12	@BipolarBear0	Old wive's tale
2014-12-11 23:13:16	@Fab500	Boof, hungry overpowers all for me
2014-12-11 23:13:18	SirNeon	I don't think that actually works.
2014-12-11 23:13:19	@BipolarBear0	Your cum tastes bad regardless
2014-12-11 23:13:22	Bino	did she throw out her dead fish? 
2014-12-11 23:13:29	Boof	that was a good joke assholes
2014-12-11 23:13:41	SirNeon	Cum doesn't taste bad. ;3
2014-12-11 23:14:10	@BipolarBear0	You may be right, I've never tasted it
2014-12-11 23:14:22	@Fab500	say what, diet definitely does have an impact on taste
2014-12-11 23:14:27	Boof	you probably have
2014-12-11 23:14:33	emr1-28	nah pineapple definitely makes cum taste better
2014-12-11 23:14:34	@BipolarBear0	General health has an impact on taste
2014-12-11 23:14:48	@Fab500	and general health is related to diet you wingnut
2014-12-11 23:14:50	@BipolarBear0	But stuffing pineapples doesn't do anything
2014-12-11 23:14:53	emr1-28	i have to go to the supermarket tonight to get more
2014-12-11 23:14:56	emr1-28	yes it does BipolarBear0
2014-12-11 23:15:00	Paradox	girl boobs
2014-12-11 23:15:00	@BipolarBear0	We're not talking about general health 
2014-12-11 23:15:00	emr1-28	this is a known fact
2014-12-11 23:15:05	@BipolarBear0	It's an urban legend
2014-12-11 23:15:12	@Fab500	yeah bear is just talking out of his ass right now
2014-12-11 23:15:13	Paradox	emr1-28 bipolar bear hasn't swallowed enough cum yet
2014-12-11 23:15:14	Bino	it works but it won't have an effect if you're doing it like a day before.
2014-12-11 23:15:16	Paradox	he doesnt know better
2014-12-11 23:15:18	emr1-28	there are straight up scientific journals written about how pineapple metabolizeds in the body
2014-12-11 23:15:22	emr1-28	and makes your cum taste better
2014-12-11 23:15:29	@BipolarBear0	I do not believe you
2014-12-11 23:15:30	Paradox	similarly, asparagus makes cum taste worse
2014-12-11 23:15:31	Boof	gracious bino
2014-12-11 23:15:32	Paradox	same with cabbage
2014-12-11 23:15:39	Paradox	and onions
2014-12-11 23:15:43	Paradox	high sulfur foods, generally
2014-12-11 23:15:43	Bino	garlic
2014-12-11 23:15:57	emr1-28	BipolarBear0: you know how when you eat asparagus, your next pee, like 20 minutes later smells awful?
2014-12-11 23:16:00	emr1-28	same concept with cum
2014-12-11 23:16:07	@BipolarBear0	Semen is different than urine
2014-12-11 23:16:08	@Fab500	things that make cum taste bad: Coffee, red meat, basically anything bitter or sulphuric
2014-12-11 23:16:12	@BipolarBear0	Different products
2014-12-11 23:16:24	@Fab500	things that make cum taste good: Fruits, most vegetables, etc
2014-12-11 23:16:32	emr1-28	^
2014-12-11 23:16:38	SirNeon	Fab500: Red meat does not make cum taste worse.
2014-12-11 23:16:43	@Fab500	yeah it does
2014-12-11 23:16:43	emr1-28	pineapple is known to have a very strong effect on making cum taste better
2014-12-11 23:16:53	emr1-28	SirNeon: I've had girls tell me that vegetarians have the best tasting semen
2014-12-11 23:17:05	SirNeon	And I've actually sucked dick.
2014-12-11 23:17:15	Boof	this conversation is too much for me
2014-12-11 23:17:20	Bino	goodnight boof
2014-12-11 23:17:31	@Fab500	Boof is going to buy some pineapple juice
2014-12-11 23:17:39	@BipolarBear0	You can say pineapple has an effect on cum
2014-12-11 23:17:41	Bino	boof is going to wank
2014-12-11 23:17:44	@BipolarBear0	That doesn't make it have an effect on cum
2014-12-11 23:17:54	@Fab500	lel
2014-12-11 23:17:55	Boof	wanking is boring
2014-12-11 23:17:56	@BipolarBear0	Pineapple is just a sugary fruit
2014-12-11 23:18:15	Boof	its like washing up
2014-12-11 23:18:19	@BipolarBear0	Otherwise people would be raving about how watermelon makes their jizz taste like Jolly Ranchers
2014-12-11 23:18:20	Boof	you dont do it for a while and it builds up
2014-12-11 23:18:22	Boof	and its a chore
2014-12-11 23:20:15	@Fab500	anyway, bear is wrong and we should move on with our lives
2014-12-11 23:20:32	@BipolarBear0	Are you telling me you've eaten pineapples for the sole purpose of trying to make your cum taste better
2014-12-11 23:20:45	emr1-28	pineapple isn't just a sugary fruit
2014-12-11 23:20:51	emr1-28	there's more in it than just sugar
2014-12-11 23:21:02	@BipolarBear0	Yes
2014-12-11 23:21:03	@BipolarBear0	Like more sugar
2014-12-11 23:21:09	Boof	i was reading bromeliads actually dissolve flesh
2014-12-11 23:21:13	celo_drunk	Fab500, penis
2014-12-11 23:21:21	@BipolarBear0	Listen, I haven't eaten a pineapple in a decade and I've never had a complaint about the taste of my cum
2014-12-11 23:21:22	emr1-28	BipolarBear0: http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/humanbody/truthaboutfood/sexy/spermtaste.shtml
2014-12-11 23:21:25	SirNeon	You know you could have just linked to the science journal about this and called it a day.
2014-12-11 23:21:26	emr1-28	fucking bbc says your wrong
2014-12-11 23:21:28	@Fab500	celo_drunk, quit being a bad influence on your kitty

2014-12-11 23:21:50	emr1-28	and you know BipolarBear0 you never get blowjobs of course nobody is gonna complain about the taste of your cum
2014-12-11 23:22:06	@Fab500	SirNeon, (un)surprisingly there is no scientific study that i could find on diet and semen taste.
2014-12-11 23:22:16	@BipolarBear0	Everyone is pretty much constantly blowing everyone else in Fort Collins
2014-12-11 23:22:21	@BipolarBear0	Both sexes
2014-12-11 23:22:37	Boof	i think i might make more grilled cheese
2014-12-11 23:22:39	emr1-28	how often are you getting blown
2014-12-11 23:22:42	SirNeon	Fab500: SCIENC
2014-12-11 23:22:44	SirNeon	E
2014-12-11 23:22:51	emr1-28	often enough so someone can fucking comment on how it tastes after you eat pineapple?
2014-12-11 23:23:04	@BipolarBear0	I mean it's not like I keep a running tally
2014-12-11 23:23:16	emr1-28	yeah it's hard to count to 0
2014-12-11 23:23:18	@BipolarBear0	I'm saying I haven't eaten pineapple in a decade
2014-12-11 23:23:19	emr1-28	woaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2014-12-11 23:23:28	@BipolarBear0	But in general nobody says my semen tastes bad
2014-12-11 23:23:29	Boof	update your tinder profile to say youre conducting an experiment to see if pineapple really does improve the taste of semen
2014-12-11 23:23:36	Boof	guaranteed sex

2014-12-11 23:24:41	Boof	you might attract people that just like drinking cum
2014-12-11 23:24:53	@Fab500	that's ok, as long as they are choosing to drink mine

2014-12-12 02:05:20	Land-O-Lurks	My last boyfriend had a farm out in the country and I barely noticed the lack of internet or cell phone service just because of you know, everything else out there

2014-12-12 02:05:46	emr1-28	growing up without an internet connection these days pretty much guarantees that you will be completely unemployable later on

2014-12-12 02:06:24	@BipolarBear0	No employers actually care about LinkedIn or social media unless it's in a related field
2014-12-12 02:06:41	Land-O-Lurks	Evident by the fact that most employers can't even use such services haha
2014-12-12 02:06:48	emr1-28	no, you need to be able to use the internet and have basic computer skills to do pretty much anything above the minimum wage these days
2014-12-12 02:07:03	emr1-28	and that will be even more of a factor in 15 years when kids today enter the job market
2014-12-12 02:07:12	Land-O-Lurks	And most if not all K-12 schools have internet and computers
2014-12-12 02:07:16	@BipolarBear0	That was always the case, though
2014-12-12 02:07:25	@BipolarBear0	If you live in a rural area without internet
2014-12-12 02:07:34	@BipolarBear0	Your circumstances and opportunities will be fit to the area you live in
2014-12-12 02:07:42	emr1-28	yeah but computer literacy these days is equivalent to actual literacy
2014-12-12 02:07:46	@BipolarBear0	If you live in an urban area but you don't have internet
2014-12-12 02:07:53	emr1-28	it's like saying that learning how to read isn't a basic human right
2014-12-12 02:07:54	@BipolarBear0	Most schools have programs for it
2014-12-12 02:08:01	emr1-28	because not all jobs require being literate
2014-12-12 02:08:12	@BipolarBear0	Being literate is a cornerstone of basic communication
2014-12-12 02:08:17	@BipolarBear0	And schools teach being literate
2014-12-12 02:08:19	emr1-28	so is using the internet
2014-12-12 02:08:22	@BipolarBear0	As they do computers and related skills
2014-12-12 02:08:25	Land-O-Lurks	And schools have internet
2014-12-12 02:08:32	emr1-28	not all schools have internet
2014-12-12 02:08:37	@BipolarBear0	Yes, in rural areas
2014-12-12 02:08:55	emr1-28	having one computer with .5mb/s internet per 100 kids is not equivalent to schools that have internet labs full of broadband enabled computers
2014-12-12 02:09:01	@BipolarBear0	So if you want to move from bird's town in Kansas to a place like New York City, you might be fucked
2014-12-12 02:09:21	@BipolarBear0	But otherwise the opportunities are there
2014-12-12 02:09:34	Land-O-Lurks	And for most kids if they end up in college will get a crash course in internet whether they want it or not
2014-12-12 02:09:35	emr1-28	no but the opportunities will not be there for people who aren't computer literate
2014-12-12 02:09:50	emr1-28	there are not going to be jobs for people who are not computer literate

2014-12-12 02:10:27	@BipolarBear0	I can't imagine a situation where someone who would enter a computer-dominant job market wouldn't have the opportunity to learn the computer
2014-12-12 02:11:25	Land-O-Lurks	In any case, I just find it weird to equate an internet connection with a human right
2014-12-12 02:11:32	Land-O-Lurks	We can argue how necessary it is to learn
2014-12-12 02:11:39	Land-O-Lurks	But a basic human right

2014-12-12 02:12:14	emr1-28	learning a computer and the internet isn't something you can figure out from a 20 minute info session
2014-12-12 02:12:21	emr1-28	it's a skill that requires many hours of experience
2014-12-12 02:12:42	@BipolarBear0	Which is why schools exist
2014-12-12 02:12:49	@BipolarBear0	And incorporate computers into their cirruculae
2014-12-12 02:13:16	emr1-28	yeah but not a lot of them actually do
2014-12-12 02:13:42	@BipolarBear0	In rural areas sure
2014-12-12 02:13:56	@BipolarBear0	But even underfunded urban school districts make strides to teach kids the computer
2014-12-12 02:14:27	emr1-28	it's a very simple fact that technology is driving inequality upward because minimum standards are rising and poor families can't keep up
2014-12-12 02:14:44	emr1-28	let's say internet was a basic human right and 100% of people had it

2014-12-12 02:31:17	emr1-28	billpika: yeah jerk off to whoever you want
2014-12-12 02:31:19	billpika	I would never do it

2014-12-12 02:31:22	 *	billpika shivers
2014-12-12 02:31:24	emr1-28	why wouldn't you do it
2014-12-12 02:31:26	@BipolarBear0	Thinking someone is attractive isn't weird
2014-12-12 02:31:28	emr1-28	ive done it thousands of times
2014-12-12 02:31:30	Land-O-Lurks	If you can't look them in the eye later, you probably shouldn't do it
2014-12-12 02:31:32	Land-O-Lurks	Otherwise
2014-12-12 02:31:33	@BipolarBear0	Absolutely thousands of times
2014-12-12 02:31:49	billpika	yeah
2014-12-12 02:31:54	emr1-28	thousands of times = once per day for three years
2014-12-12 02:31:57	billpika	guilt and stuff. i never even considered it
2014-12-12 02:32:01	emr1-28	so ive probably done it tens of thousands of times
2014-12-12 02:32:07	billpika	wow
2014-12-12 02:32:17	emr1-28	i almost always jerk it to people i know
2014-12-12 02:32:19	billpika	someone i know got into harvard today.
2014-12-12 02:32:20	emr1-28	what else is the point
2014-12-12 02:32:24	billpika	i'm inadequate
2014-12-12 02:32:40	@BipolarBear0	You masturbate once a day?
2014-12-12 02:32:45	billpika	...yes?
2014-12-12 02:32:47	emr1-28	twice usually
2014-12-12 02:32:50	emr1-28	morning and night
2014-12-12 02:32:55	emr1-28	i used to do it more like four times a day
2014-12-12 02:32:58	billpika	4 times?
2014-12-12 02:33:01	emr1-28	but my sex drive is down from my teens
2014-12-12 02:33:02	billpika	that's a lot
2014-12-12 02:33:03	@BipolarBear0	That's some excessive masturbation
2014-12-12 02:33:16	emr1-28	when i was in middle and high school my routine was liek
2014-12-12 02:33:21	emr1-28	morning when i woke up
2014-12-12 02:33:27	billpika	you know, i try practicing a little restraint.
2014-12-12 02:33:27	emr1-28	once when i got home from school
2014-12-12 02:33:30	emr1-28	and twice at night
2014-12-12 02:33:40	emr1-28	in college i used to usually jerk it twice in the morning and once at night
2014-12-12 02:33:45	emr1-28	now im down to morning and nigth
2014-12-12 02:34:02	billpika	i don't get anything out of not jerking it, but a small feeling of accomplishment and the urge to do it.
2014-12-12 02:34:04	emr1-28	but im unusually stressed right now, so itll probably rise again when i figure some things out
2014-12-12 02:34:06	billpika	#nofap
2014-12-12 02:34:23	billpika	someone i know tried to not masturbate for lent
2014-12-12 02:34:23	@BipolarBear0	I just don't have that sex drive to do it more than once a day or every two days
2014-12-12 02:34:25	billpika	he didn't make it
2014-12-12 02:34:39	emr1-28	i wish my sex drive was higher again
2014-12-12 02:34:47	emr1-28	i dont know why it dropped so much this past year
2014-12-12 02:34:54	emr1-28	stress mostly
2014-12-12 02:34:57	emr1-28	also actually having sex
2014-12-12 02:35:01	emr1-28	like regularly
2014-12-12 02:35:09	emr1-28	kind of takes some of the drive part out of it
2014-12-12 02:35:13	billpika	yeah, actually having sex will do it.
2014-12-12 02:35:13	Land-O-Lurks	You masturbate twice a day in addition to sex?
2014-12-12 02:35:53	emr1-28	yeah
2014-12-12 02:36:04	billpika	duh, he's just trying to prevent premature ejaculation
2014-12-12 02:36:11	emr1-28	well, the days i have sex usually just once in the morning
2014-12-12 02:36:17	emr1-28	the days i dont have sex, morning and nigth
2014-12-12 02:36:25	@BipolarBear0	Wake and shake
2014-12-12 02:36:30	@BipolarBear0	That doesn't really work
2014-12-12 02:37:39	billpika	morning doesn't work to stop you from awkward erections during the day
2014-12-12 02:37:40	billpika	i tried.
2014-12-12 02:37:55	@BipolarBear0	That's because you're going through puberty
2014-12-12 02:38:08	emr1-28	i don't get awkward erections through the day anymore
2014-12-12 02:38:10	@BipolarBear0	Becoming a man
2014-12-12 02:38:15	emr1-28	like, i get erections through the day
2014-12-12 02:38:18	emr1-28	but they aren't awkward
2014-12-12 02:38:21	emr1-28	they just are a thing
2014-12-12 02:38:23	@BipolarBear0	Just wear jeans
2014-12-12 02:38:37	@BipolarBear0	Or similarly thick fabric

2014-12-12 02:39:19	@BipolarBear0	Do you wear yoga pants, Land-O-Lurks?
2014-12-12 02:39:31	billpika	Land-O-Lurks how do women deal with boners
2014-12-12 02:39:38	Land-O-Lurks	Lounging around inside yeah, outside not really

2014-12-12 02:40:30	Land-O-Lurks	I only wear yoga pants or leggings outside if my top is long enough to cover ass
2014-12-12 02:40:31	emr1-28	makes my ass look great though
2014-12-12 02:40:56	billpika	i only wear yoga pants if no
2014-12-12 02:41:05	@BipolarBear0	If you lose a bet?

2014-12-12 02:45:27	billpika	i think he was bitter
2014-12-12 02:45:31	billpika	didn't
2014-12-12 02:45:33	billpika	was on my story.

2014-12-12 02:46:15	billpika	THERE WERE GIRLS IN THE PICTURE
2014-12-12 02:46:19	billpika	i think that's the problem
2014-12-12 02:46:20	emr1-28	so billpika have you given that girl a rimjob yet?
2014-12-12 02:46:25	billpika	nope.
2014-12-12 02:46:29	emr1-28	you're missing out
2014-12-12 02:46:30	billpika	she's a conservative baptist.
2014-12-12 02:46:40	emr1-28	so shes likely to go the anal rout
2014-12-12 02:46:44	billpika	boys aren't a thing for her.
2014-12-12 02:46:53	@BipolarBear0	Conservative baptists don't do traditional intercourse
2014-12-12 02:47:00	@BipolarBear0	But she's still a person with a sex drive
2014-12-12 02:47:01	emr1-28	exactly
2014-12-12 02:47:03	emr1-28	they just do anal
2014-12-12 02:47:08	@BipolarBear0	So I bet she's into rimming
2014-12-12 02:47:09	billpika	she recoils at the mention of sex.

2014-12-12 03:26:13	Land-O-Lurks	But my favorite part about her with politics is we are good friends even though we disagree on most things
2014-12-12 03:26:19	Land-O-Lurks	And she doesn't want to "offend me"
2014-12-12 03:26:43	Land-O-Lurks	But every once and a while she'll make some offhand comment about "stupid liberals" and then look at me and be like oh gosh I mean
2014-12-12 03:26:48	Land-O-Lurks	You know I don't mean you...
2014-12-12 03:27:28	Land-O-Lurks	The back pedaling is fun to watch. But it's all good. My boyfriend and I have a running bet for how long it's going to take her to get knocked up
2014-12-12 03:27:39	Land-O-Lurks	She decided she didn't want to take the pill anymore

2014-12-12 03:30:50	Land-O-Lurks	They will of course get married and have the kid
2014-12-12 03:30:57	Land-O-Lurks	That's how stable marriages are formed
2014-12-12 03:31:02	@BipolarBear0	It's a very religious mindset
2014-12-12 03:31:06	Land-O-Lurks	Yes
2014-12-12 03:31:18	emr1-28	Land-O-Lurks: my gf says she'll dump me if i get her preggers :(
2014-12-12 03:31:28	Land-O-Lurks	Why?
2014-12-12 03:31:35	@BipolarBear0	Sounds like she's not in it for the long term
2014-12-12 03:31:42	billpika	haha what
2014-12-12 03:32:03	@BipolarBear0	Then again she's still young
2014-12-12 03:32:05	emr1-28	Land-O-Lurks: so i don't have to deal with it or something
2014-12-12 03:32:08	@BipolarBear0	...er than you are
2014-12-12 03:32:19	Land-O-Lurks	emr1-28, I mean you'll deal with it in the form of child support
2014-12-12 03:32:21	@BipolarBear0	So I guess being pregnant would make more of an impact
2014-12-12 03:32:23	emr1-28	she has mixed feelings about abortion
2014-12-12 03:32:25	Land-O-Lurks	If that's what she means
2014-12-12 03:32:27	emr1-28	i don't
2014-12-12 03:32:31	emr1-28	no that isn't what she means
2014-12-12 03:32:39	emr1-28	theres absolutely no way she'd go through with having it
2014-12-12 03:32:44	@BipolarBear0	I'm pro-abortion, but of the mindset that it's ultimately the girl's choice
2014-12-12 03:32:52	billpika	it's pro-choice
2014-12-12 03:32:55	@BipolarBear0	Beyond a point you can't make her decide
2014-12-12 03:32:56	billpika	don't say pro-abortion
2014-12-12 03:33:02	emr1-28	I'm strongly pro-abortion
2014-12-12 03:33:04	billpika	because that sounds like you a baby murderer
2014-12-12 03:33:05	emr1-28	not just pro-choice
2014-12-12 03:33:07	@BipolarBear0	Pro-choice is what you use when you're talking with people who view abortion as evil
2014-12-12 03:33:08	emr1-28	i am pro-abortion

2014-12-12 03:33:22	billpika	true.
2014-12-12 03:33:25	Land-O-Lurks	Pro-abortion is by definition not murdering babies
2014-12-12 03:33:26	billpika	why am i in catholic school
2014-12-12 03:33:34	-->	Flashynuff (Flashynuff@user/Flashynuff) has joined #drama
2014-12-12 03:33:36	Land-O-Lurks	Since you can't abort a baby
2014-12-12 03:33:46	billpika	yeah but you're not gonna convince the pro-lifers.
2014-12-12 03:33:47	@BipolarBear0	I know a lot of people who equate abortion with eugenics
2014-12-12 03:33:52	@BipolarBear0	Which is a bullshit argument
2014-12-12 03:33:56	billpika	oh yeah
2014-12-12 03:34:06	@BipolarBear0	Since eugenics is state-mandated
2014-12-12 03:34:13	billpika	some assholes hijacked the #icantbreath hashtag to say "planned parenthood is literally black genocide"
2014-12-12 03:34:20	Land-O-Lurks	BipolarBear0, how do you feel about the MRA types who want financial abortion or whatever they call it
2014-12-12 03:34:26	@BipolarBear0	Ah yes billpika I know that one
2014-12-12 03:34:28	emr1-28	wait billpika where do you go to catholic school
2014-12-12 03:34:29	emr1-28	like where
2014-12-12 03:34:38	@BipolarBear0	A very pervading conspiracy theory in the right wing world
2014-12-12 03:34:38	billpika	joe biden's high school.
2014-12-12 03:34:45	emr1-28	Land-O-Lurks: I think it's a fundamentally good idea
2014-12-12 03:34:47	Paradox	your mom
2014-12-12 03:34:51	@BipolarBear0	You see the founder of Planned Parenthood once made some unsavory comments about black people
2014-12-12 03:34:56	billpika	yeah
2014-12-12 03:34:57	billpika	i know that
2014-12-12 03:35:05	@BipolarBear0	Which eventually morphed into 'Planned Parenthood was created to kill all black people'
2014-12-12 03:35:07	Paradox	Land-O-Lurks its a fundamentally good idea, but rife with potential pitfalls
2014-12-12 03:35:13	@BipolarBear0	Through... Proper sex education and prevention apparently
2014-12-12 03:35:21	Paradox	s/sex/shrex
2014-12-12 03:35:21	EDI	Correction, <BipolarBear0> Through... Proper shrex education and prevention apparently
2014-12-12 03:35:26	emr1-28	Land-O-Lurks: the problem is that child support isnt about supporting the mother, it's about supporting the baby
2014-12-12 03:35:33	SirNeon	Land-O-Lurks: I'm pro-financial abortion, but only if social safety nets are established to help support the child.
2014-12-12 03:35:41	emr1-28	but ya know, just because a guy is biologically responsible doesn't mean he has responsibility
2014-12-12 03:35:44	Land-O-Lurks	Woo lots of highlights
2014-12-12 03:35:48	Paradox	in a decently modern country, with a nice socialist government, it would work
2014-12-12 03:35:51	billpika	sorry SirNeon but obviously all single moms are welfare queens
2014-12-12 03:35:53	Paradox	but in a capitalist shithole
2014-12-12 03:35:53	emr1-28	so it's kind of a difficult idea to grapple with
2014-12-12 03:35:54	Paradox	it wouldnt
2014-12-12 03:35:56	billpika	so fuck your socialism
2014-12-12 03:36:09	@BipolarBear0	I mean I understand that the mindset of the 19th/20th century is rife with "we don't want the blacks to breed or establish successful communities"
2014-12-12 03:36:15	@BipolarBear0	But that's not what Planned Parenthood was
2014-12-12 03:36:36	@BipolarBear0	I don't know what financial abortion is, Land-O-Lurks
2014-12-12 03:36:37	Land-O-Lurks	I agree that child support is for the benefit of the child not the parent so financial abortion to me is not usually presented well. Unless you just want all single mothers to rely on welfare instead, which is fine
2014-12-12 03:36:39	Land-O-Lurks	Raising taxes
2014-12-12 03:36:46	@BipolarBear0	On who
2014-12-12 03:36:47	Land-O-Lurks	Or whatever we'd need to do for that budget
2014-12-12 03:36:49	billpika	BipolarBear0 : not paying child support
2014-12-12 03:36:52	@BipolarBear0	Oh
2014-12-12 03:36:56	@BipolarBear0	Pay your damn child support
2014-12-12 03:37:01	Land-O-Lurks	BipolarBear0, a guy saying he won't pay child support because he didn't want it
2014-12-12 03:37:12	billpika	BipolarBear0 : exactly
2014-12-12 03:37:13	Land-O-Lurks	Like "I didn't agree to this child I wanted her to get an abortion"
2014-12-12 03:37:16	@BipolarBear0	That's called being a piece of shit and not keeping your responsibilities
2014-12-12 03:37:22	emr1-28	not really BipolarBear0
2014-12-12 03:37:26	emr1-28	like
2014-12-12 03:37:29	emr1-28	if im casually dating a girl
2014-12-12 03:37:34	emr1-28	and we fuck up the bc
2014-12-12 03:37:37	emr1-28	and she gets preganent
2014-12-12 03:37:42	emr1-28	and is like oh no no way im abortin this kid
2014-12-12 03:37:45	emr1-28	that aint my problem
2014-12-12 03:37:47	Land-O-Lurks	If you're having sex with someone there is always the risk of pregnancy
2014-12-12 03:37:58	@BipolarBear0	But it becomes your problem to support the development of a human
2014-12-12 03:38:09	@BipolarBear0	Alternatively
2014-12-12 03:38:11	emr1-28	im 22 and don't have any steady income
2014-12-12 03:38:14	@BipolarBear0	You could die and the government will pay social security
2014-12-12 03:38:16	emr1-28	that kid is better of aborted
2014-12-12 03:38:18	@BipolarBear0	Based on your income
2014-12-12 03:38:23	@BipolarBear0	Oh the kid is absolutely better off aborted
2014-12-12 03:38:33	Land-O-Lurks	Yeah I don't think we're arguing that
2014-12-12 03:38:39	emr1-28	im just saying i casually slept with a lot of girls back in the day
2014-12-12 03:38:40	Land-O-Lurks	It's the fact that if the pregnancy is coming to term
2014-12-12 03:38:40	@BipolarBear0	But you're still an income source for one of the most expensive creations
2014-12-12 03:38:44	emr1-28	if one of them came to me a few months later and was like
2014-12-12 03:38:45	Land-O-Lurks	It needs child support
2014-12-12 03:38:51	emr1-28	i had a baby, its yours, and i need money for it
2014-12-12 03:38:53	emr1-28	id be like
2014-12-12 03:38:54	emr1-28	what the fuck
2014-12-12 03:38:59	emr1-28	you fuckin crazy?
2014-12-12 03:39:05	@BipolarBear0	I'm not arguing this on a moral basis
2014-12-12 03:39:05	emr1-28	nuh uh
2014-12-12 03:39:08	emr1-28	that aint my baby
2014-12-12 03:39:15	@BipolarBear0	I'd do the same thing, I'm a selfish asshole and I need to support my own life
2014-12-12 03:39:20	emr1-28	Land-O-Lurks: imagine though if someone just came up to you and was like
2014-12-12 03:39:25	@BipolarBear0	But child support is pretty much a necessity 
2014-12-12 03:39:30	emr1-28	you now owe me hundreds of dollars a month, every month, for the next twenty years
2014-12-12 03:39:35	@BipolarBear0	Unless the mother is making a significant income to singlehandedly support a child
2014-12-12 03:39:36	emr1-28	that'd be fucked up
2014-12-12 03:40:04	Land-O-Lurks	emr1-28, as I said, there is always the risk of pregnancy when you're having sex. I never thought about it much because I would have an abortion
2014-12-12 03:40:10	Land-O-Lurks	But that doesn't mean the risk isn't there
2014-12-12 03:40:20	emr1-28	ok
2014-12-12 03:40:23	emr1-28	so say someone went up to you
2014-12-12 03:40:25	emr1-28	and was like
2014-12-12 03:40:34	@BipolarBear0	Which is why I make all potential sex partners fill out a five-page questionairre before any contact
2014-12-12 03:40:39	emr1-28	you now owe me hundreds of dollars every month for the next 20 years
2014-12-12 03:40:40	billpika	BipolarBear0 good call
2014-12-12 03:40:41	Land-O-Lurks	Haha right
2014-12-12 03:40:43	SirNeon	Locking someone else into an unwanted pregnancy is kind of a dick move.
2014-12-12 03:40:46	emr1-28	because we talked at a party one night
2014-12-12 03:40:53	emr1-28	how would you feel
2014-12-12 03:40:55	@BipolarBear0	It's government mandated
2014-12-12 03:41:02	@BipolarBear0	Child support, that is
2014-12-12 03:41:05	Land-O-Lurks	I've had a lot of casual sex in my life BipolarBear0 I'm not trying to imply sex is like some sacred thing
2014-12-12 03:41:12	Land-O-Lurks	Just that if a pregnancy comes to term it needs child support
2014-12-12 03:41:13	@BipolarBear0	You aren't going to be paying if you talked to some chick at a party
2014-12-12 03:41:23	@BipolarBear0	Yes we're on the same page 
2014-12-12 03:41:26	emr1-28	yeah but if i had casual sex with someone i shouldn't be the one paying child support
2014-12-12 03:41:34	emr1-28	because i have no connection to that child
2014-12-12 03:41:35	@BipolarBear0	Well is the kid yours
2014-12-12 03:41:37	Land-O-Lurks	If it's your kid
2014-12-12 03:41:37	emr1-28	it has nothing to do with me
2014-12-12 03:41:39	billpika	fuck i should finish my chem work.
2014-12-12 03:41:41	emr1-28	no it sure as shit is not mine
2014-12-12 03:41:44	emr1-28	it sure as fuck is not my kid
2014-12-12 03:41:47	@BipolarBear0	So it's biologically not yours
2014-12-12 03:41:49	billpika	i'll be back in 5
2014-12-12 03:41:50	emr1-28	i had nothing to do with it
2014-12-12 03:41:58	@BipolarBear0	Did your sperm fertilize a woman's egg
2014-12-12 03:42:01	emr1-28	someone took the seed from me under false pretexts
2014-12-12 03:42:01	@BipolarBear0	And create this kid
2014-12-12 03:42:06	emr1-28	you know why it's a false pretext?
2014-12-12 03:42:09	@BipolarBear0	Consensual sex isn't false pretexts
2014-12-12 03:42:12	emr1-28	because i didnt agree to have a fucking kid
2014-12-12 03:42:18	@BipolarBear0	But you agreed to have sex
2014-12-12 03:42:23	@BipolarBear0	With the prior knowledge that sex = kid
2014-12-12 03:42:31	emr1-28	sex != kid
2014-12-12 03:42:35	@BipolarBear0	Sex = kid
2014-12-12 03:42:37	emr1-28	no
2014-12-12 03:42:39	@BipolarBear0	Sex is biologically intended to = kid
2014-12-12 03:42:59	emr1-28	look BipolarBear0 i know this issue seems easier to you because you never got any
2014-12-12 03:43:07	@BipolarBear0	It seems easier to me because I can logic
2014-12-12 03:43:14	emr1-28	but as someone who has gone through phases where i have had decent amounts of casual sex
2014-12-12 03:43:24	emr1-28	the idea that someone can pin a baby's life on my is horrifying
2014-12-12 03:43:26	emr1-28	it's life ruining
2014-12-12 03:43:28	@BipolarBear0	Congrats, sex is pleasurable
2014-12-12 03:43:30	@BipolarBear0	But going in
2014-12-12 03:43:36	@BipolarBear0	You know that sex creates a child
2014-12-12 03:43:40	emr1-28	it is 100% equivalent to telling a woman that she isn't allowed to have an abortion
2014-12-12 03:43:43	emr1-28	100% equivalent
2014-12-12 03:43:44	@BipolarBear0	Not only does it theoretically create a child
2014-12-12 03:43:45	emr1-28	there is no difference
2014-12-12 03:43:47	billpika	ah fuck
2014-12-12 03:43:52	@BipolarBear0	Sex is intended to create a child
2014-12-12 03:44:02	emr1-28	sex is not intended to create a child
2014-12-12 03:44:03	@BipolarBear0	So unless you take the ignorance route then you can't claim shit
2014-12-12 03:44:04	emr1-28	because condoms
2014-12-12 03:44:05	billpika	emr1-28 sorry, but you were the other half.
2014-12-12 03:44:13	@BipolarBear0	Condoms are intended to prevent sex from creating a child
2014-12-12 03:44:16	@BipolarBear0	Which is what sex is intended to do
2014-12-12 03:44:20	billpika	there are no guarantees in life
2014-12-12 03:44:23	@BipolarBear0	Different purposes for different devices
2014-12-12 03:44:34	billpika	and intentions don't  mean much
2014-12-12 03:44:34	emr1-28	billpika: you go to catholic school stfu you don't know what sex is like
2014-12-12 03:44:47	Land-O-Lurks	Do you want to play the dick measuring game with casual sex
2014-12-12 03:44:50	Land-O-Lurks	because I'm pretty sure I win

2014-12-12 03:45:00	emr1-28	BipolarBear0: it is 100% equivalent to trap a man into a pregnancy as it is to trap a woman
2014-12-12 03:45:01	@BipolarBear0	Everything you say seems to consist of you assuming that you're the only person in the world to have fucked
2014-12-12 03:45:03	Land-O-Lurks	Don't assume that you need to have experience to have certain views
2014-12-12 03:45:09	billpika	emr1-28 hahahahahaha i may be a virgin but my friends sure aren't
2014-12-12 03:45:23	@BipolarBear0	There are 7 billion people because of people fucking
2014-12-12 03:45:31	@BipolarBear0	And that only happened because sex = kid
2014-12-12 03:45:34	emr1-28	saying that a 19 year old kid is responsible for some stranger's baby is 100% equivalent to telling a woman that she can't have an abortion
2014-12-12 03:45:55	@BipolarBear0	That's just consequences, man
2014-12-12 03:45:55	billpika	it was so funny at mass when a couple stood together getting communion and i knew they had fucked.
2014-12-12 03:46:07	@BipolarBear0	You can be a dumb kid, and that's your right
2014-12-12 03:46:18	@BipolarBear0	Not you specifically, everyone is a dumb kid
2014-12-12 03:46:26	billpika	emr1-28 be careful
2014-12-12 03:46:27	@BipolarBear0	But when you have sex with the knowledge that it leads to a child
2014-12-12 03:46:32	emr1-28	so then why is a woman allowed to abort in cases that don't involve rape or life threatening stuff
2014-12-12 03:46:41	emr1-28	why does she get to absolve herself from responsibility
2014-12-12 03:46:42	emr1-28	but i cant
2014-12-12 03:46:42	billpika	because it is her choice.
2014-12-12 03:46:47	emr1-28	why does she have complete control over my future
2014-12-12 03:46:49	@BipolarBear0	Because the woman is the carrier
2014-12-12 03:46:51	billpika	it is her body.
2014-12-12 03:46:54	emr1-28	for 9 months
2014-12-12 03:46:55	billpika	she bears the risk

2014-12-12 03:47:00	billpika	bruh
2014-12-12 03:47:02	@BipolarBear0	Problem solved
2014-12-12 03:47:07	emr1-28	9 months = <5% of 18 years
2014-12-12 03:47:35	billpika	so?
2014-12-12 03:47:47	billpika	a soldier goes to war for a month
2014-12-12 03:47:50	billpika	he  comes back with PTSD
2014-12-12 03:47:51	billpika	bam
2014-12-12 03:47:53	emr1-28	so saying that the woman gets some special privilege because she gets 9 extra months with the kid is bs
2014-12-12 03:47:54	billpika	a month to ruin his life
2014-12-12 03:47:59	Land-O-Lurks	You have control over your future when you choose to have sex with people and how you choose to have sex with them. Should you like purposefully ponder your life every time you have sex? No. But that doesn't make the risk you take any less true
2014-12-12 03:48:10	billpika	emr1-28 everyone is against you. drop it.
2014-12-12 03:48:16	@BipolarBear0	So adjust your mindset then
2014-12-12 03:48:19	emr1-28	ok so Land-O-Lurks a woman shouldn't be allowed to abort

2014-12-12 03:48:30	@BipolarBear0	You're going into sex knowing that you can't control whether you keep the child
2014-12-12 03:48:33	@BipolarBear0	Under any circumstances
2014-12-12 03:48:45	@BipolarBear0	And knowing that the government is against you when it comes to not supporting the child
2014-12-12 03:48:54	@BipolarBear0	So you have to adjust your actions suitably with this knowledge
2014-12-12 03:49:00	emr1-28	she knew that she could get pregnant when she first took her clothes off
2014-12-12 03:49:05	@BipolarBear0	And you knew that too
2014-12-12 03:49:05	emr1-28	so she shouldn't be allowed to abort
2014-12-12 03:49:15	SirNeon	emr1-28: Well, I suppose you could always kill her if she refuses to abort.
2014-12-12 03:49:25	billpika	SirNeon with the practical solution.
2014-12-12 03:49:27	Land-O-Lurks	If you kill her early enough it won't be double murder
2014-12-12 03:49:31	Land-O-Lurks	Just one

2014-12-12 03:49:52	@BipolarBear0	But in the real world it's your responsibility to either take precaution or deal with the results of not taking precaution
2014-12-12 03:50:13	billpika	just kill every woman you have unprotected sex with emr1-28
2014-12-12 03:50:14	Land-O-Lurks	And emr1-28 because telling soeone not to get an abortion is actively restricting what they do with their own body. You having sex with someone does not

2014-12-12 03:51:05	emr1-28	if i needed to pay a few hundred extra per month, I wouldn't have been able to go to school

2014-12-12 03:51:28	SirNeon	The mindset of their position is that a woman has a choice on whether or not to lock someone into an undesireable situation, whereas a man does not, and that is unfair.
2014-12-12 03:51:51	billpika	emr1-28 and they fucking deserve it.

2014-12-12 03:52:33	@BipolarBear0	Would you say having a kid is a desireable position
2014-12-12 03:52:42	billpika	fuck man
2014-12-12 03:52:44	billpika	this discussion
2014-12-12 03:52:53	emr1-28	BipolarBear0: the woman knew the risks of having a kid when she decided not to abort
2014-12-12 03:52:59	@BipolarBear0	Of course she did
2014-12-12 03:53:00	emr1-28	she should be held responsible for her actions
2014-12-12 03:53:03	SirNeon	BipolarBear0: It can be.
2014-12-12 03:53:07	@BipolarBear0	And she retardedly chose not to get an abortion
2014-12-12 03:53:20	@BipolarBear0	But that doesn't make what comes after that choice desireable
2014-12-12 03:53:26	billpika	emr1-28 dude you have no power in that situation, then
2014-12-12 03:53:34	Land-O-Lurks	And to add to that, the support is not for her, it's for the kid
2014-12-12 03:53:44	Land-O-Lurks	You are punishing the child for a poor decision on the mother's part
2014-12-12 03:53:48	@BipolarBear0	Raising a child is fucking hard
2014-12-12 03:53:52	emr1-28	Land-O-Lurks: it's her fault the kid exists

2014-12-12 03:54:24	@BipolarBear0	And is a person
2014-12-12 03:54:53	@BipolarBear0	And now he hates his dad because his mum, who is retarded and didn't get an abortion, can't get by on her meager waitress/stripper salary and his dad doesn't pay child support
2014-12-12 03:55:13	@BipolarBear0	And then he'll grow up without basic quality of life because of lack of income
2014-12-12 03:55:18	@BipolarBear0	Basic quality of life like internet access
2014-12-12 03:55:25	emr1-28	not my problem, because 8 months earlier i told a judge that i absolved myself of responsibility, allowing her to make an educated decision about whether or not she wants to keep the child
2014-12-12 03:55:31	emr1-28	you see how easy this could be
2014-12-12 03:55:47	@BipolarBear0	We're on the same page morally, I'm sure
2014-12-12 03:55:47	Land-O-Lurks	Yes it's so easy to set up a child for failure right out the gate
2014-12-12 03:55:50	Land-O-Lurks	I'm sure he asked for it
2014-12-12 03:55:52	@BipolarBear0	If I were in this situation
2014-12-12 03:56:04	@BipolarBear0	Had casual sex, girl got pregnant, didn't get an abortion
2014-12-12 03:56:23	@BipolarBear0	I'd absolutely try to preserve my own quality of life over the mother's and child's
2014-12-12 03:56:41	@BipolarBear0	Because an extra $400 a month would destroy me and ultimately I care about myself more than anyone else
2014-12-12 03:56:45	@BipolarBear0	And I'm fine with that
2014-12-12 03:57:00	emr1-28	i can not pay an extra $400/month right now
2014-12-12 03:57:03	@BipolarBear0	But I also acknowledge the fact that another human being with no choice in the matter will have a shite life because of the entire scenario
2014-12-12 03:57:03	emr1-28	that is impossible for me
2014-12-12 03:57:07	billpika	then be careful, man
2014-12-12 03:57:14	@BipolarBear0	So with all this in mind
2014-12-12 03:57:36	@BipolarBear0	I take the necessary precautions so that I don't knock a girl up and end up putting myself or another living being in a less-than-desireable scenario

2014-12-12 06:02:37	@BipolarBear0	There aren't stable currencies so let's introduce an unstable currency

2014-12-12 06:05:12	bridgesfreezefirst	these countries already have their own local currencies
2014-12-12 06:05:38	emr1-28	yeah but I'm saying that, ya know, you take technologies and form factors that are already proven in the developing world
2014-12-12 06:05:48	emr1-28	and you take the conditions that have allowed them to proliferate there
2014-12-12 06:06:00	bridgesfreezefirst	what those countries need are stronger legal institutions and better infrastructure
2014-12-12 06:06:11	emr1-28	yeah I don't disagree with that
2014-12-12 06:06:12	@BipolarBear0	What they need is America
2014-12-12 06:06:18	emr1-28	but that's much harder to build than a cell phone network
2014-12-12 06:06:24	bridgesfreezefirst	introducing a new type of currency isn't going to have that large an effect
2014-12-12 06:06:53	emr1-28	digital payments have had a huge effect already in these countries

2014-12-12 06:07:51	@BipolarBear0	I mean in some ways I can see the fundamentals being there
2014-12-12 06:08:11	emr1-28	not hard to envision that in the next couple of decades a lot of these countrys that are shunning paper currency by necessity and have weak governments will use currencies that allow them to become more autonomous and avoid rampant government corruption
2014-12-12 06:08:19	@BipolarBear0	People have no access to basics like water or shelter in certain African/Middle Eastern nations yet everyone is on Twitter
2014-12-12 06:08:26	emr1-28	india is I think the case where it has the most chance to catch on
2014-12-12 06:08:39	bridgesfreezefirst	besides 1. a cell phone network is infrastructure and 2. telecommunications and banking are just two of the institutions which need improvement and reform
2014-12-12 06:08:55	bridgesfreezefirst	Bear brings up a valid point
2014-12-12 06:08:57	emr1-28	cell phone networks are cheap though
2014-12-12 06:09:02	emr1-28	that's what I'm getting at
2014-12-12 06:09:11	@BipolarBear0	In relation to other infrastructure maybe
2014-12-12 06:09:18	bridgesfreezefirst	water, electricity, and transportation are unreliable in these countries
2014-12-12 06:09:25	emr1-28	how long do you think it will be before the congo has a functional legal system?
2014-12-12 06:09:33	@BipolarBear0	But quality of life overall isn't going to improve because of cryptocurrency
2014-12-12 06:09:34	emr1-28	yet cell phones are already widely proliferated there
2014-12-12 06:09:36	bridgesfreezefirst	improving those would have a much more visible impact
2014-12-12 06:09:51	bridgesfreezefirst	legal institutions...that's another issue
2014-12-12 06:09:51	@BipolarBear0	So it's not necessarily an argument against developing other infrastructure
2014-12-12 06:09:57	emr1-28	yeah but bridgesfreezefirst you keep talking about how we need to build this and we need to build that
