2014-10-18 03:55:54	fletom	mercwithamouth: I find PyCharm to be a bit enterprise-y and Java-y but mostly amazing.
2014-10-18 03:56:01	txtsd	Hello. How can I make a single .exe for my program on linux? I'm making it for someone and they can't be bothered to install python and follow steps to install dependencies.
2014-10-18 03:56:05	Wild_Cat	IDEs don't work really well with Python in general.

2014-10-20 23:41:33	kadoban	iron_hou1: Are you assuming that 'min' picks the shortest one? It doesn't.

2014-10-20 23:42:30	kadoban	iron_hou1: "min" on lists does something like the lexicographic ordering of them unless I'm very badly mistaken...which is possible but I don't think so.

2014-10-20 23:43:55	acorwin	moqca: i would start by looking up the pyPdf docs and seeing what it expects about delegates.xml, probably
2014-10-20 23:44:09	moqca	acorwin: That would be PythonMagick
2014-10-20 23:44:19	moqca	acorwin: It fails when trying to read a pdf
2014-10-20 23:44:30	kadoban	iron_hou1: I think you can use the 'key' parameter of min to change how it decides by what criteria you want the min
2014-10-20 23:44:35	moqca	acorwin: It loks for a delegates.xml file but can't find it. Well, that's what I think

2014-11-02 22:28:45	thekabal	Hello. I’m working with Salt Stack, and have specifically a python question. I have a python script, and in it, I’m using subprocess.call to launch a shell command (rpm -qa postgresql*-server), and assign its value to a variable. I’ve inherited this script and do not understand python very well. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be “chopping up” the variable correctly. Here is what I have so far: http://paste.debian.net/129922/

2014-12-12 00:12:25	nmz787_i	so I have avoided py3k out of habit, until about 9 months ago when I started avoiding on purpose since watching this video a while ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obt-vMVdM8s
2014-12-12 00:12:51	nmz787_i	but I'm wondering, in the 4 years since those results came out, have there been improvements to fix this ?
2014-12-12 00:13:06	kadoban	someprimetime: But in terms of your actual problem...hmm. Maybe try building up a dictionary which maps each "description" to which key to keep, or which key(s) to delete. You only need to loop through your dictionary once to do this.
2014-12-12 00:13:15	simpson	yoLo_: Pretty much. Why? What were you planning to build?
